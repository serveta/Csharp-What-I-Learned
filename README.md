# Csharp-What-I-Learned
This repository consists of C# codes that I learned at school.

# About this repository and me
About 5 years ago, I started to code for the first time with C#. During this period (about 4 months), I took a regular look at C# language for the first time with my school. This gave me the opportunity to consolidate my C# knowledge.

The reason I started sharing what I learned about C# here was that I had to start using GitHub from somewhere.

Of course, I did not find the opportunity to share everything I learned here. However, I can say that I have managed to keep my information up to date thanks to my posts here.

# Some notes
I took my lessons in Turkish, but in order to appeal to everyone, I shared everything in English.
